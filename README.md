# mirth-experiments

Programs written in the [Mirth](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth) programming language.

At present, Mirth doesn't have a module system, so you have to paste the code in these file at the end of the `mirth.mth` file that is included in the distribution and then build the resulting file that is defined in each file with a C compiler.
